# Java-Writing-Analyser
A simple command line application which can ingest and analyse bodies of work to create a signature for the writing style of their author. Signatures can be compared, including signatures of unknown authors against stored signatures in order to allow the attribution of anonymous work to an author with a similar writing style.

This project was completed as part Object-oriented Programming and Software Engineering at UWA.
